;A

This file, if it exists in the MASTER directory, is copied to your
output file immediately following the header line.

MakeNL treats this file in special ways.  When it is copied into your
output file, the first string of four pound-signs (#) it finds will
be replaced with the current year.  Also, to insure that the
difference file contains a copyright notice, the entire contents of
this file will appear as an "add" field in a difference file, WHETHER
OR NOT IT HAS CHANGED! (So keep it short!)

The ";A" interest flag above is not required, but will override the
default ";S" flag.  The former is interpreted by most nodelist
processors to mean "copy this comment to all output files," while the
latter usually means "Sysop comment, don't copy to ourput lists, only
to comments file."  That's not usually the intent of a copyright
notice.
