                            MakeNL Revision History

       v3.3.3 -- Jan 14, 2012

            Update the docs/felten.txt file to UTF-8
            Update docs/fts-5000.txt with current FTS-5000.004 version.
            -- Robert James Clay

       v3.3.2 -- Dec 28, 2012

            Change default for MINphone to 1.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.3.1 -- Dec 25, 2012

            Include Copyright, Prolog, and Epilog files in all nodelist
            segments, not just in composite nodelists.  The filenames (by
            default) are cpyright.txt, prolog.txt, and epilog.txt in your
            master directory.  They can be overridden with the COPyright,
            PROlog, and EPIlog statements in your makenl.ctl file.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.3.0 -- Nov 12, 2012

            Release version of v3.2.19 for wide distribution.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.2.19 -- Nov 09, 2012

            Fixed a _findfirst() bug in the MS C versions.  Thanks for 
            Wilfred van Velzen (2:280/464) for tracking this down.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.2.18 -- Nov 04, 2012

            Changed MakeNL to default to allowing -Unpublished- phone
            numbers for Down nodes.  This is the behavior of Ben Baker's
            original MakeNL.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.2.17 -- Oct 23, 2012

            MakeNL now creates .MSG files with FTS-1 date/time fields,
            instead of using SEAdog format.
            -- Andrew Leary

       v3.2.16 -- Oct 16, 2012

            Added test directory for .CTL files to test functionality of
            development versions.  Refactored mklog().  Debug logs are sent
            to the logfile if LogLevel is higher than 1, or we're running
            in debug mode (makenl -d.)  Added support & fixes for building
            with lcc-win32.  Added support for Watcom Linux build.  
            -- Andrew Clarke

       v3.2.15 -- Oct 15, 2012

            Fixed a bug that resulted in setting the FTS-1 Unused bit
            instead of the HoldForPickup bit in MakeNL-created .msg files.
            Fixed another bug that resulted in stripping all attributes
            except Crash and Hold from MakeNL-created Receipt .msg files.
            -- Andrew Leary


       v3.2.14 -- Oct 14, 2012
       
            Various logging code changes, attempting to fix a few
	    potential buffer overflows, including writing the command-line
	    arguments to the log file. Minor code clean up in other areas.
	    Also cleaned up the output slightly when using MakeNL
	    interactively.
            -- Andrew Clarke


       v3.2.13 -- Oct 2, 2012

            Counting v3.2.9a as v3.2.10, v3.2.9b as v3.2.11, and v3.2.9c
            as 3.2.12; setting this patch version as v3.2.13.
            Debian packaging is separately versioned and is now tracked
            on its own branch; remove debian/ directory.
            -- Robert James Clay


       v3.2.9c -- Sep 19, 2012 (Bugfix)

            Incorporated logfile bugfix (SourceForge ID#3531669.)
            Thanks to Ulrich Schroeter (2:244/1120) for tracking
            this one down and submitting a patch.
            -- Andrew Leary


       v3.2.9b -- Feb 23, 2012 (Bugfix)

            Allow use of -Unpublished- with Hold nodes without
            enabling Allowunpub, as per FTS-5000.002.
            -- Andrew Leary


       v3.2.9a -- Feb 8, 2010 (Bugfixes)
	    
	    Removing superfluous usage of MAKE_SS() in src/makenl.c
	    and src/msgtool.c.
	    Remove format related warnings in src/mklog.c.
            Fixes for Watcom C build.
	    -- Andrew Clarke

	    Updated the support information in docs/whatsnew.txt,
	    especiallly that for the Bug Tracker.
	    -- Robert James Clay


       v3.2.9 -- Jan 31, 2010 

	    Release version of 3.2.7e for wide distribution.
	    -- Robert James Clay

	   
       v3.2.8 -- Feb 1, 2009 (Not Released)

	    Someone hatched out an entirely unofficial v3.2.8 archive
	    and the consensus was that we would skip that version and 
	    go directly to v3.2.9.
	    -- Robert James Clay

	   
       v3.2.7e -- Dec 8, 2007 (Bugfix)

            Fix for a bufferoverflow in the OS/2 version.
	    -- Michiel Broek.


       v3.2.7d -- June 1, 2007 (Bugfixes).

            Don't allow -Unpublished- for Down and Hold nodes if Allowunpub
	    is not set.
            Don't include copyright, prolog and epilog unless we make the
	    composite list.
	    If copyright, prolog or epilog is missing and we are making a
	    composite list, a warning is shown and logged.
	    -- Michiel Broek.


       v3.2.7c -- May 28, 2007 (Bugfix).

            Improved check for misspelled -Unpublished-.
	    Check for Alpha phone number, if there are no alpha characters
	    in the phone field treat the field as a normal phone number and
	    do the normal checks for a valid phone number.
	    -- Michiel Broek.


       v3.2.7b -- May 23, 2007 (Bugfix).

            Added compiler defines to support 64 bit platforms.
	    Fixed case sensivity to change -unpublished-, only change real
	    errors.
	    -- Michiel Broek.

       v3.2.7a -- ???


       v3.2.7 -- Apr 19, 2007 (Release version)

	    Release version of 3.2.6d for wide distribution.

	   
       v3.2.6d -- Apr 08, 2007 (Another bugfix)

            lineread in mkdiff.c returned the empty line with the EOF char.
	    This causes a diff file with the last Copy command to copy one
	    line too many.
	    Fixed file open in some places to handle textfiles as binary to
	    make the code more portable between platforms.
	    Cleanup old files now uses the right filename extensions for the
	    archiver that is used in the .ctl file.
	    -- Michiel Broek & Kees van Eeten.

       v3.2.6c -- Mar 31, 2007 (Bugfix version again)

            Removed the EOF character from the diff file because some systems
	    can't process a diff with EOF character.
	    -- Michiel Broek.

       v3.2.6b -- Mar 24, 2007 (Bugfix version)

            The diff files created on *nix systems had mixed cr-lf and lf
	    line terminators. I think the non *nix versions were ok.
	    I added a EOF character too in the diff file.
	    -- Michiel Broek. 

       V3.2.6a -- Mar 04, 2007 (Bugfix version)

            Hold or Down nodes in the RIN section of the nodelist were flagged
	    as error.
            -- Michiel Broek

       V3.2.6 -- Jul 22, 2005 (Release version)
            
            Bugtracker #2 addendum - corrected baudrate check for 9600 - mbroek
            Requested Change from Z2:

            As requested by Franz Zimmer via Ulrich Schroeter's translation:

            the last changes in code after 3.12 to 3.13 is about Nodes and
            their points. If a Bossnode is flagged as Hold in the nodelist,
            the points listed under this bossnodes should be listed. It
            makes sense, 'causethe Hold implies a temporary offline
            state, so points doesn't moves to another bossnodes.
            If the Bossnode is flagged Down or Pvt, the points under such
            a boss should be removed by makenl. If a Bossnode is Down,
            it implies that this is not only temporary and Points often moves
            to other Bossnodes.

            Hopefully this will welcome R24 nodes to try this version and report
            any issues they encounter.

(Gee the commit message took longer than implementing the
code snippet :)

       
       V3.2.5c -- Jul 18, 2005 (development/bughunt version)

            Bugtracker bug #2. While this bug was about the name field,
            it is fixed by adding a check on the baudrate field that
            should have been there. Any list if valid baudrates in the
            .ctl file wasn't checked too. 
            NOTE: not a new version yet, we wait on some other tests.

       V3.2.5b -- May 23, 2005 (development/bughunt version)

            Added logging of the OS and used compiler. Added logging of the
            commandline and arguments.
            Minor change to detect a bug in the OS/2 32 bit version


       V3.2.5 -- December 12, 2004

            Added new .ctl keyword FORcesubmit, parameter must be 0 or 1,
            default is 0. This forces submitting of unchanged segments but
            only if the -P is used on the commandline.
            Fixed some configuration keywords with wrong parameter checks.
            -- Michiel Broek

       V3.2.4 -- December 6, 2004

            MakeNL now no longer supports the '/' character for specifying
            switches on the command line.  This is to allow full path names
            to be used in the UNIX port.  The non-UNIX versions of MakeNL
            no longer support '/' style switches either, for consistency.

            When specifying switches on the command line please use '-'
            instead of '/', eg. "makenl -c", NOT "makenl /c".
            -- Andrew Clarke

       V3.2.3 -- October 8, 2004

            When makenl starts with logging enabled, the current
            directory and the name of the .ctl file is logged so that
            if you run several setups using a common logfile you can
            see which setup is being used. 
            Whatsnew.txt updates.
            Added a check to see of both ArcCopy and ArcMove keywords
            are used or not used. -- Michiel Broek
       
       V3.2.2 -- September 5, 2004

            Added logging. Two new keywords for the .ctl file are
            added, LOGFile and LOGLevel.
            Fixed the error that the wrong incoming segments were
            processed if several filenames before the extension were the
            same. This bug was introduced with version 3.1.10
            Fixed problems with created netmails with strange numbers,
            dissapearing netmails etc caused by a buffer overflow.
            Changed the way netmail headers are written, it must now
            be machine endian independent. 
            The netmail fromname now shows "MakeNL versionnr".
            -- Michiel Broek

       V3.2.1 -- August 8, 2004

            It is now possible to send hub or host network segments
            compressed. See whatsnew.txt and the example .ctl files how
            to use this.
            Added /C to the usage screen. -- Michiel Broek

       V3.2.0 -- August 1, 2004 -- Version nr change

            Only the version number is changed to allow packaging with
            8.3 filenames. -- Michiel Broek

       V3.1.10 -- August 1, 2004 -- New Features

            10 ArcOpen commands are allowed in the .ctl file.
            New segments received in the uploads or mailfiles directories
            may be compressed with any defined ArcOpen compressor.
            Increased the optional parameters for the archiver commands
            to five fields for the rar archiver.

            Minor bugfixes -- Michiel Broek

       V3.1.9 -- July 25, 2004 -- New Features
       
            Always will write full node address into NetMails with or 
            without INTL in ctl file. -- Michiel Broek
            
            NetMail now contains MSGID's.  A tracking file sequence.dat
            is stored in the "master" directory.  -- Michiel Broek
            
            Case of file names should all be lower regardless of OS.
       
       V3.1.8 -- July 20, 2004 -- New Features
       
            Added /c commandline (/credits)  Displays a brief credit
            paragraph and exits. -- Robert Couture
            
            The /h parameter now displays a nice, concise help message
            that better explains the commandline parameters.
            -- Andrew Clarke.
            
            Minor bugfixes.
                            
       V3.1.7 -- July 12, 2004 -- New Feature additions
               
            Changed version numbering to: Major.Minor.Sub  
            
            Added:
            
            "** Dedicated to Ben Baker - The Original Author of MakeNL **"
            
            To the splash line when the program runs.
            
            All  credits for additional work will be added to a credits.txt 
            file.  I think  it  is  most appropriate that Ben gets the main 
            credit for the original work.
            
            Behaviour  of  -Unpublished- without Pvt  is  NOT  allowed by 
            default.  This allows  for  current  drop  in  replacement in
            systems  today with  no  changes.  This makes it usable right
            away while we decide the outcome of separating the two.

            To change it to allow -Unpublished- w/o Pvt add:

            ALLOwunpub 1  (0 or not in CFG disables)

            I have added  the  ability  to have ALPHA characters in the 
            Phone field.

            As with ALLOwunpub, it is OFF by default.

            To turn it on add:

            ALPHaphone 1 (0 or not in CFG disables)

       V2.52 -- April 16, 1998 -- Y2k patch (Bjorn Felten -- 2:203/0)

            Patched  the  year  written  in  attach  and  receipt  mail.
            Removed  the  check for Hi ASCII and "erroneous" baud rates.
            Reformatted PRN files into TXT files.

       V2.51 -- June 15, 1992 -- Maintenance release

            To check for erroneous duplicate numbers, MakeNL maintains a
            stack of zone numbers, region/net numbers within the current
            zone,  and  node  numbers  within  the  current  region/net.
            FidoNet Zone  1 was  about to  overflow  this stack.    This
            release changes the stack implementation.  It is now limited
            only by available memory.

            The entire program was recompiled with MS C V7.0 and several
            minor changes were made to eliminate new warnings.

       V2.50 -- February 12, 1991 -- New features

            By default,  the  first  line  of  distribution  lists  from
            earlier  versions  contained  "FidoNet  Nodelist   for. . ."
            FidoNet is a  registered trademark of  Tom Jennings.   While
            Tom hasn't  complained about  this  behaviour, he  has  every
            right to, so  now the default  is "  Nodelist for.  . ." (no
            name at all).

            Since version 2.00, the /N command line switch would  insert
            a name other than "FidoNet" in the first line, and it  still
            does.  A new configuration verb, NAMe, has been added to  do
            the same.  The difference is that now, if you really want it
            to say "FidoNet  Nodelist for. . ." you have  to explicitly
            tell MakeNL the name is "FidoNet" by one of these methods.

            I am told that some  mailers require all out-going  messages
            to contain the ^AINTL extended address  kludge.  With a  lot
            of grimacing and head-shaking,  I have added the  capability
            to force  MakeNL  to  do  this.   See  the  SUBmit  verb  in
            MAKENL.PRN.

       V2.41 -- January 25, 1991 -- Code bug, documentation bug

            There are only two  ways MakeNL can  know your zone  number.
            You explicitly tell it in your NETADDR statement, or, if you
            are making a zone list, MakeNL can guess it.  Failing either
            of these methods, your zone number is set to zero.   Usually
            this doesn't matter, but. . .

            If MakeNL generates a  message to a zone-qualified  address,
            and he doesn't know your zone  (i.e. your address is set  to
            zone 0), MakeNL failed to notice and both the message header
            and the INTL kludge were generated malformed.  This has  now
            been fixed.  Under the stated condition, MakeNL will issue a
            warning and NOT generate the message.

            Last time I added the PUBlish verb to the code.  This time I
            added it to the documentation!

       V2.40 -- December 1, 1990 -- New features.

            Version 7 of ARC uses considerably more memory than  earlier
            versions.  MakeNL now  checks free memory,  and if there  is
            less that 256K, it swaps itself out of memory before execut-
            ing ARC.  If there is an expanded memory driver loaded,  and
            enough expanded  memory available,  MakeNL will  use it  for
            swap space.  Otherwise  it swaps to  a temporary disk  file.
            When swapped out, only about one kilobyte plus your environ-
            ment space remain in memory.   This behaviour is  transparent
            to users, and requires no action on their part.

            A new  configuration verb,  BAUdrate,  was added  to  permit
            redefinition of  MakeNL's baud  rate validity  table.   This
            allows for  future growth  without continual  recompilation.
            See section  6.1.6  on  page 24  of  the  documentation  for
            complete details.

            Added a  second configuration  verb,  PUBlish, to  define  a
            publication day other than Friday.

       V2.31 -- August 8, 1990 -- New feature, bug Corrected.

            Added ARC <n> control verb, where <n> may be either 5 or  6.
            It is used to force ARC version 6 or 7 to create level-5  or
            level-6 compatible archives.  Note that it will cause errors
            if <n> is greater than or equal to your ARC version number.

            MakeNL had  another string  length  error.   A  12-character
            array was having  a string of  up to  12 characters  scanned
            into it.  That doesn't leave  much room for the null  termi-
            nator.  The size of the array was increased.

       V2.30 -- June 3, 1990 -- New feature, bug Corrected.

            Added MINPHONE control  verb.   If causes  MakeNL to  reject
            phone numbers with  fewer than a  defined minimum number  of
            parts. (See documentation.)

            A file entry in the FILES section of a control file may  in-
            clude an alternate notification address.  MakeNL was  limit-
            ing the length of this address to seven characters -- a  bit
            confining.  The string has now  been extended to 17  charac-
            ters.  This will permit an alternate address with a  5-digit
            zone, a 5-digit net, and a 5-digit node number.

            FTS-0005.TXT was added to the distribution.   It is the  re-
            placement document for FSC002-3.

            The documentation was updated to reflect these changes, how-
            ever the sample  control files were  not changed to  include
            any instances of MINPHONE.

            Recompiled the entire program using MSC 6.00, which resulted
            in about 10% reduction in size of .EXE file.

       V2.20 -- 10/06/89 -- Significant Bug Corrected.

            Why this one wasn't reported before now is beyond me!   When
            MakeNL received more than one new submittal difference  file
            at once, all but the first  would fail to apply because  the
            CRC was not  being reinitialized.   RCs  probably don't  get
            many difference files, but how could DD go a year and a half
            without noticing this problem?

            The program salutation and the documentation title page were
            changed to reflect the new release level.

            The obsolete "FSC002-3"  was dropped  from the  distribution
            archive.

            No other changes were made.

       V2.12 -- 05/31/88 -- Bug(?) Corrected.

            For some reason (as yet unidentified), memory allocation  in
            the difference  analyzer (changed  in V2.11)  behaves  badly
            when MakeNL is executed  on an 8088  machine.  This  release
            modifies the routine to get  around the problem, and  should
            work in the most adverse conditions (I hope).

       V2.11 -- 05/15/88 -- New behaviour.

            The FidoNet nodelist has become larger than earlier versions
            could produce difference files  for.  The current  version's
            difference analyzer has been modified to segment long  files
            and analyze the segments.  After a segment is analyzed,  the
            differences are output, then processing proceeds to the next
            segment.

            Some time ago, Tom Marshall, IFNA Council, pointed out  that
            any copyright contained in the original document should also
            be contained in any published difference file.  The  program
            at that time was forcing about four lines of the notice into
            the difference file.  Since I was modifying the routine that
            does it anyway, the difference analyzer was also modified to
            force any copyright notice in full into the difference file.

            The changes made do not affect documentation, and it was not
            changed.

       V2.10 -- 04/12/88 -- New feature, docs updated, minor bug fixed.

            A new control  file statement, "PRIvate,"  was added to  the
            repertoire to  control the  processing of  private nodes  in
            networks which discourage or do not permit them.

            The documentation received many  cosmetic changes.  Some  of
            the change bars  merely reflect the  movement of figures  to
            produce better pagination.  The substantive changes are doc-
            umentation of the /NAMe command line switch and the  PRIvate
            control file statement.

            The /NAMe command line switch was added in version 2.00, but
            seems to have been overlooked in the documentation,  includ-
            ing this file.  It provides  the capability of changing  the
            network name placed on the first line of a composite list.

            One minor bug was discovered which could cause problems only
            with a rare combination of events.  Since I have had no  re-
            ports on it, I guess no one ever noticed it, but I fixed  it
            anyway!

       V2.03 -- 03/12/88 -- Bug fixed

            A bug was introduced in 2.02 which caused the PVT and  OGATE
            keywords to be exchanged on output.   This, of course,  pro-
            duces a very confused nodelist!

            IT IS IMPERATIVE that if you ran V2.02 in process mode, that
            you upgrade to 2.03 IMMEDIATELY.   Errors generated by  2.02
            will "stick" until 2.03 corrects them.  Note that this  cor-
            rection should be automatic  and require no intervention  on
            your part.

            No other changes were made in  this version.  There were  no
            documentation changes.

       V2.02 -- 03/05/88 -- Bug fixed, added feature

            If the first data file is not processed (happens  frequently
            in test mode) MakeNL returned an erroneous result code.  The
            problem was caused by an uninitialized variable.  You  would
            not notice this one until you  tried to use MakeNL's  result
            codes to automate weekly processing in a daily event in your
            batch file.

            One minor feature  was added.   MakeNL will  now accept  the
            keyword "OGATE"  in a  net list.   (OGATE  is invalid  in  a
            Region.)  In order to use OGATE, you and all coordinators in
            the chain above you must be  using V2.02!  Earlier  versions
            of MakeNL will reject the OGATE  keyword.  For this  reason,
            the documentation  has  not  been updated  to  reflect  it's
            support at this time.

            No other changes were made in  this version.  There were  no
            documentation changes.

       V2.01 -- 01/16/88 -- Bug fixed

            Found a bug that's been there  since the beginning of  time.
            Wonder why nobody ever reported it???  In the FILES  section
            of the .CTL and  explicit file name might  be as many as  12
            characters (file name (8) plus "." (1) plus extension  (3)),
            but the field width was set to 11!

            The only   other changes made  in this version  is that  the
            entire package has been  recompiled with MS  C 5.0.   Please
            advise me immediately of any problems encountered!

            Documentation has not  changed, however, the  order of  this
            file was reversed (newest version first).

       V2.00 -- 12/28/87 -- Distribution restrictions removed

            Ken Kaplan expressed concern over  the logistics of the  re-
            quirement for IFNA  control of the  distribution of  MakeNL.
            Therefore, with this  release distribution restrictions  are
            removed and MakeNL will be distributed as "shareware" in the
            future.  See section 9 in MAKENL.PRN for details.

            New feature:

            This release extends the level of NL maintenance all the way
            to individual nodes.  Note that Coordinators may still fully
            maintain their segments if they wish, but now they may  also
            require each node to maintain its own entry in the list.

            If you wish to make use of this feature, I suggest you  cre-
            ate a file for each node in your segment and mail it to  the
            applicable node with a message  text reading "Enclosed is  a
            file containing  you  nodelist  entry.   If  there  are  any
            changes, edit this  file and  mail it back  to me.   DO  NOT
            CHANGE THE FILE NAME."  Replace each NL entry with an appro-
            priate NODE entry in the FILES section of your control file,
            set up an external event to execute MakeNL daily, and forget
            about 'em.

            Old feature:

            The "indentation" feature of the  files section of the  con-
            trol file  was designed  as "cut-over"  aid, and  should  no
            longer be needed.  MakeNL still supports it, but all  refer-
            ences to it have been removed  from the documentation.   The
            next release will remove it from the program.

            Several minor bugs were found and fixed.

            DOCs with change bars:

            MAKENL.PRN received  more  updates  than  the  program  did!
            Change bars have been added in  the right margin to  reflect
            changes since  V1.21.   Figures 2  through 7  were moved  to
            avoid several nearly  blank pages.   Since  the change  bars
            were added  automatically, this  action caused  several  in-
            stances of  false change  bars.   Oh  well, you  can't  have
            everything.  Nothing that WAS changed escaped being  marked.
            It's just  that  some  marked  passages  were  not  actually
            changed.

       V1.21 -- 11/14/87 -- MERGE clarified

            The requirements for  the MERGE option  were not clear,  and
            code did not test that necessary network address information
            was present. So:

            1)   Added ability for MakeNL to select a default  net-
                 work address based on  MAKE command if  NETaddress
                 data is missing.

            2)   Changed MERGE to  use the first  zone it finds  in
                 the  distribution  file  if  no  zone  address  is
                 available.

            3)   Changed MERGE to  cancel if no  region or net  ad-
                 dress is available.  This only happens when MAKing
                 a HUB, and no NETaddress command is given.

            Added "change bars" to right margin of documentation.   This
            edition reflects changes since V1.10.

       V1.20 -- 11/08/87 -- Bug fixes, one added feature

            Bug fixes:

            1)   This wasn't really a bug. The MS library date/time
                 handling routines seem  to make automatic  adjust-
                 ments for DST (at  the wrong cross-over points,  I
                 might add).  According to their docs, setting  the
                 environment variable "SET TZ=CST+6" should turn it
                 off, but they lie!  They recognize the minus sign,
                 but not the plus sign.

                 "SET TZ=CST6" will turn  it off, but MakeNL  can't
                 rely on that being set right.

                 The problem occurs just after the date MS thinks a
                 change to or from DST should have happened and you
                 run MakeNL within an hour  the wrong side of  mid-
                 night.  Day numbers for backward dates get screwed
                 up because the time  gets shifted across the  mid-
                 night boundary, and MakeNL  can't find its  master
                 files!

                 Well, it's fixed, and  I'm sorry for any  inconve-
                 nience it may have caused.

            2)   Fixed a problem in renaming master files two weeks
                 old.  (They were being deleted.)

            3)   Fixed a  similar  problem renaming  output  master
                 files when no changes occur.

            4)   Fixed some minor problems surrounding the creation
                 of archives and difference files.  If you  specify
                 an OUTDIFF parameter,  you should  force the  cre-
                 ation of  archives as  well as  difference  files,
                 EVEN IF NO CHANGES  OCCUR AND YOU WOULD  OTHERWISE
                 GENERATE NEITHER!  Now you do.

            New Feature:

            If you use a generic OUTFILE name, and if you create differ-
            ence and/or archive files, they  tend to accumulate in  your
            OUTPATH directory  over  time.   By default,  MakeNL ignores
            them completely.  This is done so that OUTPATH can point  to
            a "download" directory where several editions might be  made
            available to users.

            I had some complaints about this behaviour.  Some users don't
            appreciate having to "clean up after  MakeNL!"  So, I  added
            the CLEanup command to MakeNL's repertoire in this version.

            When MakeNL operates in process  mode and CLEanup (no  argu-
            ments) appears in the control file, after all other process-
            ing is done, it searches the OUTPATH directory for old  dif-
            ference and/or archive files and deletes any it finds.

            CLEanup has no effect  on current files  or the handling  of
            output master files.  It has no effect whatever when  MakeNL
            is operated in test mode.

       V1.10 -- 08/19/87 -- Bug fixes

            This release is mostly bug fixes, but a new feature has been
            added, and behavior has been modified in one respect.

            Bug fixes:

            1)   A check was added to insure that all defined  data
                 directories are distinct.   V1.00  loses files  if
                 two are defined for the same directory.

            2)   Corrected a bug in the  parsing of the /M  command
                 line switch.

            3)   Added a  check for  and  removal of  IBM  extended
                 characters in text fields.

            4)   Corrected file move operation  to account for  the
                 use of the DOS JOIN command.

            5)   Corrected bugs in  directory (path)  verification.
                 In fact  the function  was  rewritten, and  is  (I
                 hope) close to bullet proof.

            6)   Removed the use of  "DOS COPY" to eliminate  false
                 warning messages.

            Added feature:  Added the "NOTIFY SELF" statement to control
            file.

            Modified behavior:  ALL output except merge file goes in the
            defined OUTPath directory, or if not defined, in the  MASter
            directory.  V1.00 places submittal and distribution files in
            the current directory.

       V1.00 -- 08/11/87 -- Initial Release
