ToDo: MakeNL Debian packaging
=============================

- The debian/copyright file has been updated to a new machine readable format,
  but the copyright information (specifically authors and years) still needs
  to be up verified and updated as necessary.
    src/exec.h  - noted as being public domain    

- Package build is defaulting to using CMake but while building an 'makenl.html'
  file from the 'makenl.txt' is present in the existing docs/Makefile, that
  functionality has not yet been added to docs/CMakeList.txt. So until the
  https://sourceforge.net/p/makenl/bugs/22/ has been resolved, remove the
  installation of a 'makenl.html' file from the package build.

- Investigate if having a separate makenl-doc might be usefuil. (Recommended
  with Debian Policy v3.9.7)


    - Lintian results of a full build under 'buster':
I: makenl source: out-of-date-standards-version 3.9.8 (current is 4.3.0)
I: makenl source: testsuite-autopkgtest-missing

- I: makenl source: debian-control-has-obsolete-dbg-package makenl-dbg
  - https://lintian.debian.org/tags/debian-control-has-obsolete-dbg-package.html
  - The needed version of debhelper needed for the new 'dbgsym' pkg is not 
  available for, for intance, jessie or trusty so for now not changing it.

- I: makenl: hardening-no-bindnow usr/bin/makenl
  - https://lintian.debian.org/tags/hardening-no-bindnow.html
  - What I've tried so far has made no difference so for now this is pending
  further investigation.
