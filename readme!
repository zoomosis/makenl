Important Changes since MakeNL 2.5x:
====================================

ARC:
----
  The ARC keyword no longer works as documented in the old MakeNL
  documentation. MakeNL 2.5x only had support for Arc compression,
  but 3.1.8 now supports multiple compression utilities, through
  configurable archiver entries following the ARC keyword. The older
  ARC keyword only expected one parameter, but the new version
  expects at least three, with an optional fourth field. To provide 
  compatibility with MakeNL 2.5x, the ARC keyword must be commented
  out of the MAKENL.CTL file, which will cause MakeNL to default to
  Arc compression as before.
  
  ** Currently, ARC or ARCcopy works for this feature. ARCmove and
  ARCopen are also partially implemeted, but are not complete. In
  the future it is possible that the ARC keyword itself will be made
  obsolete, and these new keywords will be used instead.

  The new syntax of the ARC keyword is as follows:

  ARC [x] [archiver exe name] [archiver command] [command switches]

  The [x] tells MakeNL what the first character of the final archive
  of the stub will be. For zip, you would list z, resulting in *.znn
  output files.

  Here are some examples of commonly used archivers, and the commands
  that work with them:

  InfoZip: ARC z zip -o
  Rar: ARC r rar -a -ep
  Arj: ARC j arj -a -e

ALLOwunpub:
-----------
   ALLOunpub is a new keyword that will cause MakeNL to allow the
   -Unpublished- string to be present in the sixth (phone number)
   field of node listings, without requiring the Pvt keyword to be
   present in the listing. This keyword is disabled by default. To
   enable it, add ALLOwunpub 1 to your MAKENL.CTL file.

ALPHAphone:
-----------
   ALPHAphone is a new keyword that will cause MakeNL to allow alpha
   characters to be present in the sixth (phone number) field of node
   listings. This keyword is disabled by default. To enable it, add
   ALPHAphone 1 to your MAKENL.CTL file.
